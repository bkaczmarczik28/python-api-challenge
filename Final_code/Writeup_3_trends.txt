#3 observable trends on WeatherPy API-Challenge Homework #6

1). Data was collected on 10/05/2019. As expected, there is a parabolic trend in shifting temperature
around the equator, where the temperature decreases as it gets further away from the equator
where the latitude is 0 degrees.  

2). The minimum observed temperatures are closer to the North Pole rather than Antarctica. 
This is expected, because the North pole is approaching it's winter season, when the Earth's tilt 
positions the North Pole further away from the sun as compared to the South Pole. We would 
expect regions closer to the North Pole to be colder than regions closer to the South Pole.

3). Relative humidity is fairly high across the data set, well above an ambient 40%. This
may be due to a number of regions starting and ending their rainy/monsoon seasons around the world.
There are a few clusters of data points that also seem to suggest a number of analyzed cities that were 
randomly selected are within close proximity to each other. The graph may tell a different store
it a set of cities were analyzed. 

4). Windspeed and cloudiness seems fairly independent of latitude due to the random scattering of data
However, the cloudiness % data is fairly interesting by the fact various latitudes were measured to have
the exact same value, which generates horizontal lines on the graph. This may be due to the fact
their metric for evaluating cloudiness is more a ranking scale by discreet values rather then
a quantifiable continuous measurement.
